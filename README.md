# AP-Physics-C-Final-Project
Final project for my AP Physics C class, by Reng and Bryan.

We coded in Java Processing to bring forth this single-player 8-ball pool game.
The goal is to get all the numbered balls into the 6 holes at the various parts of the field.
There is no penalty for getting the cue ball in (since it's single player), so it'll just be placed back at its starting position
You do things by clicking and dragging on the cue ball. If you click on the cue ball without dragging, it'll stop the cue ball in place.
You win by getting all of the balls into the holes.

There are three options you are given at the start.

The first is normal 8-ball single player pool, with only the above things happening.

The second is 8-ball pool with a magnetic field and an adjustable charged cue ball.
At the bottom, there is a slider that controls how strong the magnetic field is on the table, and another slider that controls the charge of the cue ball. This lets you add a curve onto the trajectory of the cue ball, though the purpose is still to try to get the other balls into the holes (the other balls are not charged, only the cue ball is)

The third and final choice is 8-ball pool with an obstacle in the center and also magnetic fields. The obstacle serves just to be somewhat of a more difficult barrier (you should take advantage of magnetic field to go around it!)

We recognize that there are some slightly weird collisions between balls (mostly visual because motion and collision are parallel)

Anyways, have fun!

(turning up the charge and magnetic field really high with also high velocity makes for really nice coincidental collisions with lots of balls)
