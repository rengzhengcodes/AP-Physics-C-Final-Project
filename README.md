# AP-Physics-C-Final-Project
Final project for my AP Physics C class, by Reng and Bryan.

We coded in Java Processing to bring forth this single-player 8-ball pool game.
The goal is to get all the numbered balls into the 6 holes at the various parts of the field.
There is no penalty for getting the cue ball in (since it's single player), so it'll just be placed back at its starting position
You do things by clicking and dragging on the cue ball. If you click on the cue ball without dragging, it'll stop the cue ball in place.
You win by getting all of the balls into the holes
